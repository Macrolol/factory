# AI Factory

## Project Description

The idea for this project is to provide a graphical user interface for orchestraiting groups of AI agents. Currently the project is very much in its infancy, but the idea is to provide a framework for creating and running jobs which can be comprised of multiple agents performing different tasks, as well as other components such as data collection, conditial logic, and more. If you have ever used Azure Data Factory, the idea is similar, but for AI agents instead of data.

## Technologies

The project is built with sveltekit, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.


## Credits

I used many of the components from https://github.com/mohamadadithya/take-mine as a starting point for this project.
